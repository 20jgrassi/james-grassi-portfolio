This folder contains Java projects I worked on during the course:
CS187 - Intro to Data Structures
@ University of Massachussetts Amherst
Fall 2020, Freshman Year

My work was done in the src folder of each project.
We were given a framework of code to work with, but the bulk of the useful code in each src folder was done by me.

Throughout the course, I learned to use techniques and data structures such as:
Linked Lists
Binary Search Trees (& Scapegoat Trees)
Graphs
Sets
Hash Tables
Heap Queues
Breadth First Searches & Depth First Searches
Abstract Classes & Interfaces

Both .zip and unzipped versions of each project file are given.
