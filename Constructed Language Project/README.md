## Constructed Language Project

This project's repository is elsewhere.

You can find it here at https://github.com/weatherwhim/weatherwhim.github.io. Alternatively, you can visit the site itself at https://www.weatherwhim.github.io.

I interact with certain online communities under the username weatherwhim. This username has its own GitHub account, for hosting work which is both publicly accessible and directed towards the online communities that know me by that title.

The webtools I host on this site are currently used by members of the online [toki pona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toki_Pona) community. You can find more information on the site repo itself. The site is in progress, with more tools intended in the future.
