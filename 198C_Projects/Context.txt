This folder contains C projects I worked on during the course:
CS198C - Introduction to the C Programming Language
@ University of Massachussetts Amherst
Spring 2020, Freshman Year

Some of the code in each project was from a template,
but the core of the programs' functionality was implemented by me.
(Usually this work is located in the src directory, in the files other than main.c
and in the header files in the include directory.)

You can see the unaltered templates by unzipping the project.zip or
equivalent file in each folder.

Throughout the course, I learned to use techniques and data structures such as:
Using the Bash shell
Pointers, pointer arithmetic, referencing and dereferencing
Dynamic memory allocation and freeing memory
Bitwise operators
Structs and programming in non-object-oriented languages
Header files, C macros, and understanding the C preprocessor

Both .zip and unzipped versions of each completed project file are given.
